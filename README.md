The project above is a simple implementation of the classic game of rock-paper-scissors.
The code reads in a dataset that contains information about past games of rock-paper-scissors, trains a decision tree model on this data, 
and then uses the trained model to play against the user.

The user is prompted to input their move (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer generates its move by using the trained decision tree model to predict the outcome.
The outcome is then displayed to the user, along with the current score, and the game continues for a specified number of rounds.

The project is a good example of how machine learning algorithms can be used to solve problems in various domains, including gaming.
It's also a good example of how simple games can be implemented using Python and machine learning algorithms.
